						<p>You'll need to call Public Works. <!-- add contact info --></p>

						<p>If you would like to temporary close a residential street for non-commercial purposes, you can apply for a block party permit.

A block party does not require a STEP.</p>

						<p>If your event is for commercial purposes, you'll still need a Short-Term Event Permit. Please continue!</p>

					<div id='street-yesAgain' class='hidden module'>
						<p>If a larger road closure is necessary, you’ll need to work with a licensed engineer to provide a Maintenance of Traffic (MOT) plan, and submit that to the Public Works department.
